## Getting Started

### Demo

#### Playground

To see a working playground in action, run the workspace located at path `M13Checkbox Demo Playground/LaunchMe.xcworkspace`. You may need to run the framework scheme and wait for Xcode to process the files, before the playground begins. Open the assistant editor for a live preview of the UI. 

This is a great way to work on customizing the checkbox in code to suit your needs.

#### App

To see the checkbox working on a device, run the demo app included in `M13Checkbox.xcodeproj`. The demo app walks through all the available features. You will need to run a `pod install` in order to build the demo app.

### Installation

#### Cocoapods

The easiest way to install M13Checkbox is through CocoaPods. Simplify add the following to your podfile.

```
pod 'M13Checkbox'
```

#### Carthage

To install via Carthage, add the following to your cartfile:

```
github "Marxon13/M13Checkbox"
```

#### Swift Package Manager

To install via Swift Package Manager, add the following as a dependency to your Package.swift file:

```
.Package(url: "git@github.com:Marxon13/M13Checkbox.git", versions: Version(2,2,0)..<Version(2,2,3)),
```

#### Manual

Another option is to copy the files in the "Sources" folder to your project.

### Use

#### Storyboard

Add a custom view to the storyboard and set its class to "M13Checkbox". Customize the available parameters in the attributes inspector as needed.

**Note:** A shim was added to add support for setting enum properties through interface builder. Just retrieve the integer value corresponding to the enum value needed, and enter that into the property in the attributes inspector.

#### Programmatically 

Just initialize the checkbox like one would initialize a UIView, and add it as a subview to your view hierarchy. 

```
let checkbox = M13Checkbox(frame: CGRect(x: 0.0, y: 0.0, width: 40.0, height: 40.0)
view.addSubview(checkbox)
```

##Project Structure

**M13Checkbox**
The main interface for M13Checkbox is the `M13Checkbox` class. It is a subclass of `UIControl` and handles the configurable properties, as well as touch events. 

**M13CheckboxManager**
Each `M13Checkbox` references an instance of `M13CheckboxManager`, which controls the appearance and animations of its layers. The manager passes a set of layers to the `M13Checkbox`, which adds the layers to its layer hierarchy. The checkbox then asks the manager to perform the necessary animations on the layers to animate between states. Each animation type has its own subclass of `M13CheckboxManager`. To add an animation, subclass `M13CheckboxManager`, and add the animation type to the `Animation` enum, supporting the animation `Style` if applicable. Take a look at the existing managers to see what variables and functions to override.

**M13CheckboxAnimationPresets**
Each `M13CheckboxManager` references an instance of `M13CheckboxAnimationPresets`, which generates the animations that will be applied to layers during state transitions. The base class contains animations that are shared between multiple animation styles. An animation can subclass `M13CheckboxAnimationPresets` to generate new animations specific to the animation type.

**M13CheckboxPathPresets**
Each `M13CheckboxManager` references an instance of `M13CheckboxPathPresets`, which generates the paths that will be displayed by the layers. The base class contains paths that are shared between multiple animation styles, as well as some boilerplate code to determine which path to use. Some animations have a subclass of `M13CheckboxPathPresets` to add new paths specific to the animation type, or override existing paths to customize the look.

`M13CheckboxPathPresets` calculates the positions of the points of the checkmark with more than just a basic scaled offset. This allows the checkmark to always look the same, not matter what size the checkbox is. The math contained in the `checkmarkLongArmBoxIntersectionPoint` and `checkmarkLongArmEndPoint` are a simplified version of a human readable solution. To see the math that went into creating these equations, check out the "Math.nb" or the "Math.pdf" in the "Other" folder.

**M13Checkbox+IB**
A shim that gives the ability to set the enum values of `M13Checkbox` in Interface Builder.

##Project Details

### Requirements

- Requires iOS 9 or later.
- Requires Swift 3.0

### Support

Open an issue or shoot me an email. Check out previous issues to see if your's has already been solved. (I would prefer an issue over an email. But will still happily respond to an email.)

### Todo

- Fix the animations between the checked and mixed states when the mark is a radio. When the circle is close to being flat, the left and right edges are not rounded, as well as render some artifacts. 
- Add visual feedback for UIControl's selected state. So that when the checkbox is touched, it animates slightly towards the new state.
- Add support for interrupting animations mid-animation. So that if the checkbox is tapped multiple times in quick succession, it animates from the current values, instead of resetting the checkbox and restarting the animations. This might involve replacing CAAnimations with manually done animations using a CADisplayLink. Or the new UIViewPropertyAnimator.
- tvOS support.
- watchOS support.
- Mac OS X support.
- Checkbox cells (Re-add label support)
- Checkbox groups (single / multiple selection)
